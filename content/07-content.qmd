## Optional

- {{< fa book >}} [Introduction in Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com)^[This reading is mathy-er than what we've covered so far. It also features code from STATA, which we don't use. Don't worry about that so much; we will focus on broad concepts/ideas.]


## Slides



```{r show-slide-tabs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
# slide_buttons("/static/slides/02-viz")
# slide_tabs(slide_details, "/static/slides/02-viz.html")
```
