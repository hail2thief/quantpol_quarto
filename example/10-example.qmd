## Example using `stevedata`


Let's look at data on abortion attitudes from the `stevedata` package. We'll use the `gss_abortion` dataset.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
library(stevedata)

gss_abortion
```


We'd like to know how the average American feels about abortion, but this is unknowable: we can't survey everyone, there's measurement error, etc. 


Let's pretend for a minute that we *can* know do this: we survey all Americans, perfectly, and they are all captured in `gss_abortion`. Only 64,000 Americans exist in this imaginary world. 


What percent of Americans support abortion? We take the average of `abany` (a binary variable that equals 1 if the respondent thinks abortion should be legal for any reason):


```{r}
gss_abortion |> 
  summarise(avg_abortion = mean(abany, na.rm = TRUE))
```

So 41% of Americans in this imaginary world think abortion should be legal for any reason.


But what if instead of having access to the full population of Americans (`gss_abortion`), we only had a sample of 10 people? Let's take 1,000 samples from `gss_abortion`, each of size 10, and calculate the average support for abortion in each of those samples:


```{r}
set.seed(1990)

samples = rep_sample_n(gss_abortion, size = 10, reps = 1000) |> 
  summarise(avg_abortion = mean(abany, na.rm = TRUE))
samples
```


We can plot this:

```{r}
ggplot(samples, aes(x = avg_abortion)) +
  geom_density() + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of abortion attitudes in 1,000 samples of 10 Americans",
       x = "Proportion of Americans who support abortion",
       y = "Frequency")
```


We can see a lot of variation. Remember, the true population average is 41%. 


We can ask other questions of these sample estimates. For example, across the 1,000 samples, what is the average sample estimate of the proportion of Americans who support abortion?


```{r}
samples |> 
  summarise(avg_avg_abortion = mean(avg_abortion))
```

It's 42%, which is pretty close to the population average. 


What is the range of sample estimates of the proportion of Americans who support abortion? This is the difference between the largest and smallest sample average:

```{r}
samples |> 
  summarise(range_avg_abortion = max(avg_abortion) - min(avg_abortion))
```

In this case it's 100%, because in the smallest sample average we observed 0% support for abortion and the largest sample average we observed 100% support for abortion.
