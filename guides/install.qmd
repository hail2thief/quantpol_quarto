title: "Installing R, RStudio, and packages"
---



## Intro

You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!) programming language [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). You will use [RStudio](https://posit.co/) as the main program to access R.

There are two ways to get up and running with R and RStudio:

1. **Easy, free-to-very-cheap, way**: Run RStudio in your browser (*preferred*)

2. **Hard way**: Download and install R and RStudio on your machine ( *alternative*)

# RStudio on the web (option #1)

The easiest way to get started with R is to run RStudio in your browser. This is free and you don't have to install anything on your computer.

1. Go to [https://posit.cloud/](https://posit.cloud/)
2. Click on "Sign up" and create an account
3. Click on "New Project" and select "New Project from Template"
4. Select "Data Analysis in R with the Tidyverse" and click "OK"

# RStudio on your computer (option #2)

## Install R

First you need to install R itself (the engine).

1. If you have a **WINDOWS**, click here: [Download R for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and download the most recent version of R
2. If you have a **MAC**, click here: [Download for macOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and download the most recent version of R
3. Double click on the downloaded file (check your `Downloads` folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.


## Install RStudio

Next, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won't ever have to interact with R directly.

1. Go here: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ 
2. Scroll down, download most recent version for either Mac or Windows
2. Double click on the downloaded file (check your `Downloads` folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.

Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).

You're done!

# Install packages

Most R packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on "Install," type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter. R will download the package from the web, so make sure you are connected to wifi when you do it. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "install-r-package-panel.png"))
```


A less tedious way to do this is via the console or in your script (just make sure to delete afterwards!), by running the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("name_of_package")
```


## Install juanr (and other Github packages)


Some packages, like `{juanr}` cannot be installed using `install.packages()` because they are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/). To install `{juanr}`, you will first need to install `{remotes}` and then use `install_github()`, like so:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("hail2thief/juanr")
```
