Wrangling and pipes

. . .

Subsetting data

. . .

The (tricky!) programming objects



# The new starting point {background-color="#dc354a"}

. . .

Before, I  *wrangled* data and you plotted the finished product

. . .

First step of all your code was `ggplot()`

. . .

Now, **you** will wrangle the data 

. . .

First step is now *the data object*



## What is data-wrangling?

. . .


>  ...the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics... **Data analysts typically spend the majority of their time in the process of data wrangling compared to the actual analysis of the data.** -- Wikipedia


. . .

Most of your time working with data will be spent **wrangling** it into a usable form for analysis



## Pipes: connecting data to functions


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
directors_profit = movies |> 
  # only look at horror movies
  filter(genre1 == "Horror" | genre2 == "Horror" | genre3 == "Horror") |> 
  # calculate profit
  mutate(profit = gross - budget)
```

<br>


You've seen these before...



## What are pipes? 

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Pipes** link **data** to **functions**

- They look like this ` %>% `, or ` |> `

- Definitely use keyboard shortcuts
  - OSX: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> 
  - Windows: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd>

## Why pipes? 

. . .

With pipes: 😍

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>% 
  mutate(body_mass_kg = body_mass_g / 1000) %>% 
  select(body_mass_kg)
```

. . .


Without pipes: 🤢

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
select(mutate(filter(penguins, species == "Adelie"), body_mass_kg = body_mass_g / 1000), body_mass_kg)
```

. . .

<br>

Both produce the same output, but pipes make code more **legible**



## Making sense of pipes: "and then..."


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
directors_profit = movies %>% 
  # only look at horror movies
  filter(genre1 == "Horror" | genre2 == "Horror" | genre3 == "Horror") %>% 
  # calculate profit
  mutate(profit = gross - budget)
```

. . . 

<br>

You can read the pipe as if it said "*and then*"...

. . .


1. Take the data object `movies`, AND THEN 

2. `filter` so genre1, genre2, or genre3 equal HORROR, AND THEN 

3. `mutate` so that...




# Subsetting data and logical operators {background-color="#dc354a"}


## Our first wrangling function: `filter()`

. . .

`filter()` **subsets** data objects based on **rules**



```{r, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/filter.png")
```


. . .


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
baby_subset <- babynames %>%
  filter(name == "Angel")
```

Subset `babynames` to only babies named `Angel`


# Why filter? {.center background-color="#dc354a"}



## Why filter? {.center}

. . .

Lots of real-world **applications**: finding flights, addresses, IDs, etc.

. . .

Sometimes we want to focus on a specific **subset** of data: the South, Latin America, etc.

. . .

Useful to deal with common problems: outliers, missing data, strange responses




## The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Third largest welfare program in the US

Only people who meet certain **criteria** receive it

**Effects** of program and its **design** are hotly debated

## Identifying beneficiaries


Imagine you are the IRS, and have data on all 360+ million Americans:

. . .


```{r}
library(wakefield)
fake = r_data_frame(n = 7, sex, race, age, income, marital, children) |> 
  mutate(Marital = ifelse(Marital != "Married", "Not married", "Married"))

fake |> 
  kbl(digits = 0)
```


. . .

How could use use these variables to **identify** what benefits they should receive?




## Identifying beneficiaries


Say we wanted to identify people in the flat part of the [blue line]{.blue}



::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
fake |> 
  select(Income, Marital, Children) |> 
  kbl()
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](img/eitc.png)
:::
:::






## Using `filter()`


To use `filter()`, we need to tell R which **observations** we want to include (or exclude) using *rules*

. . .

<br>

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
gap_africa = gapminder |> 
  filter(region == "Africa")
```


Rule: return all observations from `gapminder` where the `region` variable **is equal to** "Africa"



## Making the rules: logical operators


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Rules filter data based on whether **variables** meet certain criteria

- Rules rely on **logical operators**:

  - Equal to, not equal to, less than, more than, included in, etc.
  
  - Observations that meet the rule are returned; those that are not are **dropped**

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ben.jpeg")
```
:::
:::



## The logical operators


```{r,echo = FALSE}
tribble(~Operator, ~meaning, 
        "==", "equal to", 
        "!=", "not equal to", 
        ">", "greater than", 
        "<", "less than", 
        ">=", "greater than or equal to", 
        "<=", "less than or equal to", 
        "&", "AND (both conditions true)", 
        "|", "OR (either condition is true)",
        "%in%", "IN (in the set of)") %>% 
  knitr::kable(align = "cc")
```

::: {.notes}
Why double equal sign?
:::



## Using `filter()`


Say we have some data on 🍎

```{r}
apples = tribble(~name, ~color, ~pounds, ~sweet,
        "Fuji", "red", 2, TRUE,
        "Gala", "green", 4, TRUE,
        "Macintosh", "green", 8, FALSE,
        "Granny Smith", "red", 3, FALSE)


apples %>% knitr::kable()
```





## Apples

```{r,echo = TRUE}
apples
```


::: {.callout-note}
The output reports how many rows and columns our dataset has (4 rows x 4 columns)
:::


## Green apples

```{r,echo = TRUE}
apples |> 
  filter(color == "green")
```

. . .

Notice words are in quotations!

. . .

Notice that the number of rows has decreased: `2 x 4`


## Green and unsweet apples

```{r,echo = TRUE}
apples |> 
  filter(color == "green") |> 
  filter(sweet == FALSE)
```

Notice TRUE/FALSE are all-caps!


## Apples that aren't green

```{r,echo = TRUE}
apples |> 
  filter(color != "green")
```

The <kbd>!<kbd> symbol **negates**: *not* equal to

## At least 4 pounds but less than 6

```{r,echo = TRUE}
apples |> 
  filter(pounds >= 4, pounds < 6)
```


Notice: **at least** implies *greater than or equal to*


. . .


I could also split this up over multiple `filter` calls 


```{r, echo = TRUE}
apples |> 
  filter(pounds >= 4) |> 
  filter(pounds < 6)
```


. . .




## Combinations: The OR (|) operator


"Observations where either *this* is true **OR** *that* is true"

. . .


Apples that are red OR green

```{r, echo = TRUE}
apples |> 
  filter(color == "red" | color == "green")
```


::: {.callout-note}
The <kbd>|</kbd>  should be above your Return/Enter key
:::



## Combinations: the AND operator (&)


The `&` operator can be used to combine rules

. . .

Returns observations where *both* rules are true

. . .

"Apples that are red AND sweet or green AND sour": 

. . .

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
apples |> 
  filter(color == "red" & sweet == TRUE | color == "green" & sweet == FALSE)
```




## %in% 


The `%in%` operator is super powerful

. . .

It returns observations that belong to a **set**

. . .

Say I wanted to look at just South American countries, normally:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
gapminder |> 
  filter(country == "Argentina" | country == "Brazil" | country == "Chile")
```

Brutally repetitive


## %in% 


Make a list of countries and return observations that match any of them

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
keep = c("Argentina", "Brazil", "Chile")

gapminder |> filter(country %in% keep)
```


::: {.callout-note}
To make a "list" of items (a **vector**), use `c()`
:::



## Your turn: 👑 World leaders 👑


Using the `leader` dataset, identify: 


1. A Vietnamese Emperor who, in his first year in office, was 11 years old. Famously depraved.

2. Leaders with graduate degrees who in 2015 reached their 16th year in power. 

3. A leader who held office for more than 20 years, participated in a rebellion, and has a willingness to use force score above 1.7.  


```{r}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 10L)
```


::: {.callout-note}
You can use `?leader` to see the codebook. The acronym for Vietnam is "VNM"

# Objects {background-color="#dc354a"}



## The last step: creating objects


Step 1-2: the data, the pipe, the wrangling functions


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
apples |> 
  filter(sweet == FALSE)
```

<br>

. . .

Step 3: store the subsetted data as a new **object** for later use

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
green_apples = apples |>
  filter(sweet == FALSE)
```


## Objects

In programming, **objects** can be used to store all sorts of stuff for later use

. . .

data, functions, values

. . .

We create objects using `=` or `<-`

. . .

Like this: 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
new_object = stuff |> filter(year == 1999)
```

. . .

Or like this: 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
new_object <- stuff |> filter(year == 1999)
```



## Naming objects

> *There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.*
-- Phil Karlton

. . .

Recommend: keep it short, easy to type, informative, and use `_` to separate words

. . .

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Good
gap_africa = gapminder |> 
  filter(continent == "Africa")

# Bad
Countries_In_Africa_That_I_Want_To_Look_Up = gapminder |> 
  filter(continent == "Africa")
```

. . .

I use the excellent [Tidyverse syntax guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html) in my work



## Failure to object


Without objects, your work washes away, like tears in the rain

. . .


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Here, we store our data wrangling

::: {.fragment}
```{r, echo = TRUE}
green_apples = apples |>
  filter(sweet == FALSE)

green_apples
```
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Here we didn't store

::: {.fragment}
```{r, echo = TRUE}
apples |>
  filter(sweet == FALSE)

apples
```
:::

:::
:::


. . .


Notice the original `apples` remains unchanged!



## The formula



*Wrangle* the data until you're satisfied with the output: 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
apples |> 
  filter(sweet == FALSE)
```


. . .


Store the output as a new object: 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sour_apples = apples |> 
  filter(sweet == FALSE)
```


. . .

Use the new object (e.g., plotting):

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(sour_apples, aes(x = name, y = pounds)) + geom_col()
```





## Challenge: 🗳️ The (unusual) American voter 🗳️

There's a Twitter bot that randomly tweet profiles of real voters from the Cooperative Election Study:



```{r, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/american-voter-bot.png")
```



## Challenge: 🗳️ The (unusual) American voter 🗳️


```{r}
juanr::bot |> 
  sample_n(5) |> 
  knitr::kable(caption = "A small sample of Americans")
```






## 🗳️ The (unusual) American voter 🗳️


Using `bot`:


1. Identify the most **unusual** subgroup of voters you can think of


2. Constraint: need *at least* five voters in your subgroup


3. Store your unusual subgroup as an object


::: {.callout-note}
Remember you can use `?bot` to look at the codebook
