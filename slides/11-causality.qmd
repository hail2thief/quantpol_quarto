Why causality? And what is it?

Fake data

The problem with causality




# Prediction vs. causality {.center background-color="#dc354a"}
---


## Why predict


We don't know what's going to happen in the **future**

. . .

Or in places/cases where we don't have data

. . .

Even if in cases where we have data -- what's our *best guess*? 

. . .


We can use **models** to make decisions informed by patterns in the data




## Prediction is for making decisions


World Bank: what would happen to Jamaica if their GDP went up by 10k? We can use models to make an educated **guess**



```{r}
ggplot(filter(gapminder, year == 2007), aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_nice() + 
  labs(x = "GDP per capita", 
       y = "Life expectancy") + 
  geom_point(data = filter(gapminder, country == "Jamaica", 
                           year == 2007), 
             color = red, size = 4) + 
  geom_label_repel(data = filter(gapminder, country == "Jamaica", 
                           year == 2007), label = "Jamaica in 2007",
             color = red, size = 4, nudge_x = 2e3, nudge_y = -10) + 
  geom_point(data = tibble(gdpPercap = 17321, lifeExp = 75.5), 
             color = yellow, size = 4) + 
  geom_label_repel(data = tibble(gdpPercap = 17321, lifeExp = 75.5), 
             color = yellow, size = 4, nudge_x = 5e3, nudge_y = -10,
             label = "Our estimate for Jamaica when GDP = 17k/person") + 
  annotate(geom = "rect", xmin = 7000, xmax = 8000, 
           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf, fill = red, alpha = .2) + 
  annotate(geom = "rect", xmin = 17000, xmax = 18000, 
           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf, fill = yellow, alpha = .2)
```

# A turning point {.center background-color="#dc354a"}


## First half of course


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- How to program, visualize data, modeling, relationships, etc.

- Look at all the functions you "learned":

> `group_by`, `tally`, `summarise`, `filter`, `mutate`, `%>%`, `distinct`, `lm`, `augment`, `tidy`, `ggplot`, `facet_wrap`...

- There are thousands more!

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/learning-R.png")
```
:::
:::



## First half of course


Use models to estimate the relationship between X and Y:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
mod = lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data = gapminder)
tidy(mod)
```

. . .

But is this relationship **causal**? Would an increase in GDP **cause** an increase in life expectancy, on average? 




## Second half of the course


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- "How do we know if X **causes** y?"

- Are our estimates **causal**? Academics fight about this all day!

- This question is at center of **causal inference**

- We will learn why it is so difficult to establish causality with data

- We will also learn potential solutions

# Many interesting questions are causal {.center background-color="#dc354a"}

. . .

International relations: do peace-keepers **reduce conflict** in countries emerging from civil war, or are they ineffective?

. . .

Comparative politics: do elections reduce or increase **corruption**?


. . .


American politics: do voter ID laws hurt general **turnout**? 




## But not all


**Many** of the interesting questions people want to answer with data are causal

. . .

Some are not: 

Instagram might want to know: "Is there a person in this photo?"

But not care about what factors **cause** the picture to be a photo of a person

Depends on the question; most **why** questions are causal




## The value of causality


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
One of our comparative advantages

Not just academic; companies, governments, NGOs also need to answer "why" questions

Does this policy work (or not)? Did it do what was intended? How effective or counterproductive was it?

## What do we mean by causality?


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
In this class, we say **X causes Y** if...

An **intervention** that changes the value of X produces a **probabilistic** change in Y

* [Intervention]{.blue} = X is being **changed** or altered

* [Probabilistic]{.red} = Y should change, *on average*, but need not in every instance

## Interventions and probability


How do the two parts of our definition fit here?

> Aspirin causes a reduction in fever symptoms


. . .


[Intervention]{.blue} = someone **takes** aspirin, we administer aspirin, we sneak it into someone's food, etc. 


. . .


[Outcome]{.red} = Taking aspirin doesn't work 100% of the time; but *in general*, *on average*, *more often than not*, etc., taking aspirin $\rightarrow$ less fever


. . .


What about this example? Democratic institutions reduce the incidence of interstate war




## Terminology


We've seen this before:

```{r}
tribble(~Variable, ~Meaning, ~Examples, 
        "Y", "The thing that is affected by a treatment", "Employment, turnout, violence", 
        "X", "The thing changing an outcome", "Min. wage laws, voter ID laws, peacekeepers") %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```





# The problem with causality {.center background-color="#dc354a"}
---


## Obviously causal relationships


A heavier car has to work harder to get from A to B

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point(color = blue, alpha = .8, size = 3) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  theme_nice() + labs(x = "Car weight (in tons)", y = "Fuel efficiency (MPG)")
```




## Obviously causal relationships


A bigger house is more desirable


```{r}
ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = sqft_living, y = price)) + 
  geom_point(color = blue, alpha = .8, size = 3) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  theme_nice() + 
  labs(x = "Square feet of living space", 
       y = "Price", subtitle = "Data from moderndive::house_prices") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar)
```



## Not obvious: education and earnings


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Positive correlation between education and earnings, yet
- People who are already wealthy (or likely to become wealthy) get more education than people who are not wealthy
- In other words: people **self-select** into education levels
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}

```

## Not obvious: voter ID and turnout

States that pass these laws are **different** from states that don't pass these laws

```{r,out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/vote-id.png")
```




## Spurious correlation


To make matters worse, correlation is common-place in nature:



```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/spurious-cheese.png")
```



## The trouble with causality

. . .

We can't directly observe a change in X **causing** a change in Y

. . .

This is true even in **experiments**, where we directly manipulate stuff

. . .

All we can see are **correlations** between X and Y

. . .

Some of those correlations **are** causal; some **are not**; how can we tell?




## First step: yes, we can tell (sometimes)



Students are obsessed with *"correlation does not mean causation"*

But sometimes it does! that's the tricky part

```{r,out.width="50%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/sponge-cause.jpeg")
```



## Make up (simulate) data to convince ourselves


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- A good way to see that we correlation **can** equal causation is to make up (**simulate**) data where we know that X causes Y
- We can make up data in R with the `rnorm()` function
- `rnorm()` draws random numbers from a **normal distribution**
- The numbers it makes up are pretty close to some **mean**, plus or minus a **standard deviation**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
tibble(x = rnorm(n = 5000, mean = 0, sd = 1)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) + 
  geom_density(fill = red, color = "white") + 
  labs(title = "A normal distribution with mean = 0, sd = 1")
```

:::
:::



## Drawing from a normal distribution


Generate 10 random numbers, most of which are +/- 2 away from 10:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
rnorm(n = 10, mean = 10, sd = 2)
```

. . .

Generate 5 random numbers, most of which are +/- 10 away from 50:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
rnorm(n = 5, mean = 50, sd = 10)
```

. . .


Generate 4 random numbers, most of which are +/- 100 away from -10:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
rnorm(n = 4, mean = -10, sd = 100)
```

::: {.callout-note}
n = number of draws, mean = average, sd = standard deviation
:::





## Do winners keep winning?

. . .

Say we wanted to simulate data to show that doing well in [elections (treatment)]{.blue} **causes** increases in [campaign fundraising (outcome)]{.red}

. . .

That is, that funders *reward* winners

. . .

First step is generating fake [elections results (treatment)]{.blue}


. . .


Let's say we have 500 fake elections that are pretty close to 50 (a tie), plus or minus 5 points




## Faking (simulating) the treatment


We can use `tibble()` and `rnorm()` to simulate variables

. . .

[elections (treatment)]{.blue} = 500 elections, vote share is 50% of the vote on average, +/- 5%

. . .


```{r, echo = TRUE}
fake_election = tibble(party_share = rnorm(n = 500, mean = 50, sd = 5))
fake_election
```


## And we can plot it


```{r}
ggplot(fake_election, aes(x = party_share)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = red, color = "white", alpha = .8)
```



## Making the outcome


Next we want to make up [campaign fundraising (outcome)]{.red}

. . .

Let's say parties raise about 20k on average, plus or minus 4k

. . .


```{r, echo = TRUE}
fake_election = tibble(party_share = rnorm(n = 500, mean = 50, sd = 5), 
                       funding = rnorm(n = 500, mean = 20000, sd = 4000))
fake_election
```


## And we can plot it


```{r}
ggplot(fake_election, aes(x = funding)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = red, color = "white", alpha = .8)
```



## Making X cause Y

. . .


We want to make it so that getting more votes **increases** campaign donations (winners attract funding)

. . .


Say for every percent of the vote a party gets, they get 2,000 (USD) more in donations 


. . .


this is the causal effect of [vote share (treatment)]{.blue} on [campaign donations (outcome)]{.red} $\rightarrow$ 

. . .

2,000 (USD) per percent of the vote a party gets in an election




## Making X cause Y


We can do this in R like so: 


```{r, echo = TRUE}
fake_election = tibble(party_share = rnorm(n = 500, mean = 50, sd = 5), 
                       funding = rnorm(n = 500, mean = 20000, sd = 4000) + 2000 * party_share)
fake_election
```


. . .


As an equation, this looks like: $Donations_{i} = Party\_share_{i} \times 2000$





## Eyeballing it


Is our fake data convincing? We can plot it to see:

```{r}
ggplot(fake_election, aes(x = party_share, y = funding)) + 
  geom_point(shape = 21, color = "white", fill = red, size = 2.3) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = blue) + 
  labs(x = "Party's share of the vote", 
       y = "Amount of money raised") + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar)

```



## Can we get the causal estimate back?


We **know** the effect of vote share on campaign donations: it's 2k per percent of the vote


. . .


Can we use a model to get that estimate back?


. . .


Yes!

```{r, echo = TRUE}
mod = lm(funding ~ party_share, data = fake_election)
tidy(mod)
```




## Hope?


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
* There are at least *some* scenarios where X causes Y, and 
    * This effect will be reflected in the data
    * And we can **estimate** the effect with a model

  labs(x = "Party's share of the vote", 
       y = "Amount of money raised") +

Using the steps I just went through above, make up some data that pre-confirms some pattern about the world you wish were true:


1. Change the [treatment]{.blue}
 and [outcome]{.red} variables in the code to ones of your choosing

2. Alter the parameters in `rnorm()` so the values make sense for your variables (e.g., what is a reasonable distribution for age?)

3. Make a scatterplot with a trend line -- use `labs()` to help us make sense of the plot axes!

4. Post your idea in Slack, winner (creativity + accuracy) will get small extra credit

# So we (sometimes) *can* estimate causal effects {.center background-color="#dc354a"}


# Where does it all go wrong then? {.center background-color="#dc354a"}


## The Democratic Peace?


Does the spread of democracy reduce international conflict?

. . .

Theory: war is costly and the costs are borne by citizens; countries where citizens have more input $\rightarrow$ less conflict

. . .


X here is [whether the country is a democracy]{.blue} (versus autocracy)


Y is [the number of wars the country is involved in]{.red}

. . .


Ideal, imaginary approach: take a country, look at Y when democracy = 1, and then when democracy = 0


. . .


Do this for all countries, take the average




## Potential outcomes


This magical world where we can compare the number of wars when a country is a democracy versus when it is not is called the **potential outcomes**

```{r}
dem_peace = crossing(country = c("USA", "Canada", "China"), 
         democracy = c(1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(war = rpois(n = n(), lambda = 4 + -2*I(democracy==1)))

knitr::kable(dem_peace)
```




## The fundamental problem of causality


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
In reality, we can only *observe* democracy at *one value* for each country

The US is a democracy, we can observe wars when democracy = 1, **but not when democracy = 0**

China is not a democracy, we can observe wars when democracy = 0, **but not when democracy = 1**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
knitr::kable(dem_peace)
```
:::
:::



## Potential vs. observed


We only **observe** the world on the right, but not the left

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
knitr::kable(dem_peace, caption = "Potential outcomes world")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
observed = dem_peace %>% 
  mutate(war = case_when((country %in% c("Canada", "USA") &
                           democracy == 0) | 
                           (country == "China" & democracy == 1) ~ NA_integer_, 
                         TRUE ~ war))

knitr::kable(observed, caption = "Observed outcomes world")
```
:::
:::




## The fundamental problem of causality

. . .

We have missing data on "what would have happened" had the US been an autocracy


. . .


"what would have happened" $\rightarrow$ the **counterfactual**


. . .


Our goal in causal inference is to make as good a guess as possible as to what Y would have been had democracy = 0 instead of 1 (and vice versa)



## Comparing apples and oranges


Why not just compare the number of wars for countries where democracy = 0 (autocracies) versus the countries where democracy = 1 (democracies)?

. . .


If democracies fight less, then democracy **reduces** conflict

. . .

```{r, echo = TRUE}
observed %>% 
  group_by(democracy) %>% 
  summarise(wars = mean(war, na.rm = TRUE))
```



## Comparing apples and oranges


Implicitly, this means we are saying the countries that are *autocracies* are good **counterfactuals** for the countries that are democracies (and vice versa)

. . .


For instance, that China is a good counterfactual for the US


. . .


But China and the US are different in so many ways! They are not good **counterfactuals** of one another


. . .


We will see *exactly why* this is a problem in the following weeks



## Why experiments work

In an experiment, we *randomly* expose participants to some treatment, while others are exposed to nothing (or a placebo)

. . .

```{r}
experiment = tibble(Person = 1:5, 
       `Shown an ad?` = c("Yes", "No", "Yes", "No", "No"), 
       `Democrats thermometer` = round(runif(n = 5, min = 0, max = 100) + 10*I(`Shown an ad?` == "Yes"), 2))

knitr::kable(experiment, digits = 2)
```

. . .

We then compare the outcome of those who did and didn't get the treatment





## Why experiments work


Experiments have the same "problem" as the democracy and war example: we can't observe *the same person* seeing and not seeing the ad

```{r}
knitr::kable(slice(experiment, 1:2), digits = 2)
```


. . .


But since the experimental ad was *randomly* assigned, the people that did and didn't see the ad are good **counterfactuals** of one another

. . .


it is, **by definition**, just as likely a person who received treatment could have instead received the control/placebo (note how this differs from [democracy]{.blue} $\rightarrow$ [war]{.red})



## The gold standard


This is why experiments are known as the **gold standard** of research

. . .


We have control over **treatment**, and we **randomize** it

. . .

With **observational data** that already exists in the world, we *don't* have control over treatment, and we *can't* randomize it

. . .

Experiments are great, but not feasible or ethical in most cases

. . .

So we'll have to take other measures to try to overcome these problems with observational data



## 🧩 Your turn: counterfactuals 🧩


With neighbor, think through the counterfactual scenarios in these examples. What is the implicit counterfactual? What would a good counterfactual look like?


1. A study on whether international trade between two countries makes them more likely to form a defensive alliance.


2. A study on whether being a victim of a crime makes someone more supportive of authoritarian leaders


3. A study on whether those who served in the military are more likely to vote for "dovish" or "hawkish" candidates


4. A study on whether post-*Dobbs* abortion restrictions reduced abortions
