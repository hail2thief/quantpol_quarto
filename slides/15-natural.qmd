## Garbage can models


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
* for a long time there was a tendency to estimate **"garbage can" models**
* throw every variable under the sun into regression model, hope for the best
* in some cases, no pre-meditated *treatment* variable
* little recognition that of tradeoff between controlling for **forks** but avoiding **pipes/colliders**

## Causal inference



::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
* More recently: a greater emphasis on worrying about **causality**
* Recognition that confounds are lurking everywhere, and we should worry about them
* Recognition that **pipes** and **colliders** means we *shouldn't* just throw every variable into a model

## Improvements but obvious limits

. . .

IF we can correctly specify our model (i.e., control for all backdoors, leave front-doors open) we will identify the effect of X on Y

. . .

Easier said than done! Often there is some confound (like W) that we **know exists but can't measure**, or worse, **don't know exists at all**


```{r, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
dagify(Y ~ X + W + Z + G, 
       X ~ W + G, 
       Z ~ G,
       outcome = "Y", 
       exposure = "X", 
       latent = "W") %>% 
  ggdag_status() + theme_dag() + theme(legend.position = "none")
```




## The causal revolution


Hard to correctly specify the DAG and measure all the variables; what can we do?

. . .


Ideal = an experiment -- where *treatment is randomly assigned* -- but this is rarely feasible



```{r,out.width="50%"}
dagify(Support ~ Ad + Age + Income + Race + Region + Religion +
         Parents + Media, 
       Income ~ Region + Parents, 
       Religion ~ Parents, 
       Media ~ Parents + Religion + Age + Region, 
       exposure = "Ad", 
       outcome = "Support") %>% 
  ggdag_status(text = FALSE, use_labels = "name") + theme_dag() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = wesanderson::wes_palettes$Darjeeling1, 
                     na.value = "grey20") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = wesanderson::wes_palettes$Darjeeling1, 
                     na.value = "grey20")
```



## Natural experiments


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
* Alternative - find moments, situations, or weird, freak occurrences where some group is exposed to some *treatment* **by chance** while another group was not

* These weird moments in history are called **natural experiments**

* As though nature accidentally created an experiment

## The (fake) data


Go out and collect data on people who were and were not in gifted:


```{r}
fake_students = r_data_frame(n = 10000, name, age, grade, sex, height, smoker = valid) %>% 
  mutate(test = runif(n = n())*100) %>% 
  mutate(gifted = ifelse(test >= 75, "yes", "no")) %>% 
  mutate(earnings = rgamma(n = n(), 2) * 20000 - 25000 * I(gifted == "yes") + 
           1000 * test)
fake_students |> 
  sample_n(8) |> 
  select(Name, Age, Grade, gifted, earnings) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 0)
```




## The results


Big gifted program premium: `r scales::dollar(coef(lm(earnings ~ gifted, data = fake_students))[2])` more in earnings


```{r}
avgs = 
  fake_students %>% 
  group_by(gifted) %>% 
  summarise(earnings = round(mean(earnings), 0))
ggplot(fake_students, aes(x= gifted, y = earnings, 
                          color = gifted)) + 
  ggbeeswarm::geom_quasirandom(size = 2, alpha = .9) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) + 
  scale_color_paletteer_d(palette = "nationalparkcolors::BlueRidgePkwy", 
                          direction = -1) + 
  theme_nice() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(y = "Current salary", x = "Was the respondent in gifted?") + 
  geom_label_repel(data = avgs, aes(label = paste0("Avg: ", scales::dollar(earnings))), 
                   size = 5, fontface = "bold", nudge_y = 30000, 
                   nudge_x = .2)
  
```


::: {.notes}
Does this mean gifted caused this, or even some of it?
:::





## The problem


So many potential confounds, including ones that are really, really hard to measure (like [ability]{.red}) and others that are *unknown*


```{r}
dagify(earnings ~ gifted + family + location + ability + unknown, 
       gifted ~ family + location + ability + unknown, 
       exposure = "gifted", 
       outcome = "earnings", 
       latent = "ability") %>% 
  ggdag_status(text = FALSE, use_labels = "name") + theme_dag() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```



## The solution


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
* To get into gifted you typically need a certain score on an aptitude/IQ test


* Imagine that the **cutoff** score is 75/100; above you're in gifted, below you are not

* This cutoff is known as the **assignment mechanism** = why some receive treatment (gifted program) or not

* How was that cutoff chosen?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, out.width="70%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/phrenology.jpeg")
```
:::
:::





## The solution


The precise **cutoff** is completely arbitrary; could have been 74.5, or 76, or 80, or whatever

. . .

The *arbitrary* nature of the cutoff creates a **natural experiment**

. . .

A student who a 76 and a student who got a 34 are probably very different; 

. . .


if one makes more money than the other today, is that because of gifted? or other factors ([ability]{.red}?)

. . .

But a student who got a 76 and one who got a 74 are probably interchangeable

. . .

Few points difference might be function of: **random** error, luck, whatever





## The natural experiment


If we look *only* at students who scored close to the 75 cutoff we have the makings of a **natural experiment**

. . .


Around cutoff, essentially random whether you get treatment (gifted program) or not



. . .


Why? Score on test = [ability]{.red} + luck + measurement error



. . .


Example: Joe got a 74 and Amy got a 76; if they took the test many times, how often would Joe score worse than Amy?


. . .


“Natural experiments”: situations where some *thing* (often a rule) creates random assignment of treatment





## Looking around the cutoff


In analysis terms, (can be) simple: look only at students who scored close to 75, let's say +/- 2:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
subset_students = fake_students %>% 
  filter(test >= 73 & test <= 77)
```


. . .

Then we estimate model on this group; let's also estimate in the full (confounded!) sample


```{r, echo = TRUE}
wrong_model = lm(earnings ~ gifted, data = fake_students)
discon_model = lm(earnings ~ gifted, data = subset_students)

```


::: {.callout-note}
The difference between these two models is the **sample** the model is being fit to
:::



## The results {.scrollable}


Ouch! Looks like being in gifted actually **hurts** students in the long-run:


```{r}
huxreg("all students" = wrong_model, "students near cutoff" = discon_model, 
       statistics = "nobs", number_format = 0)
```





## Visualize it


People with higher aptitude/training/ability/etc. better off today:

```{r}
ggplot(fake_students, aes(x = test, y = earnings)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = .8) + 
  theme_nice() + 
  labs(x = "Score on IQ test", y = "Current salary") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar)
```




## The cutoff


```{r}
ggplot(fake_students, aes(x = test, y = earnings, 
                          color = gifted)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = .8) + 
  theme_nice() + 
  labs(x = "Score on IQ test", y = "Current salary", 
       color = "Gifted?") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) + 
  scale_color_paletteer_d(palette = "nationalparkcolors::BlueRidgePkwy", 
                          direction = -1) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 75, lty = 2, size = 2, color = "red")
```



## The natural experiment


```{r}
ggplot(fake_students, aes(x = test, y = earnings, 
                          color = gifted)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = .8) + 
  theme_nice() + 
  labs(x = "Score on IQ test", y = "Current salary", 
       color = "Gifted?") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) + 
  scale_color_paletteer_d(palette = "nationalparkcolors::BlueRidgePkwy", 
                          direction = -1) + 
  annotate(geom = "rect", xmin = 73, xmax = 77, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf, 
           fill = "coral3", alpha = .4)
```




## The discontinuity


These are the students who, **by chance**, just barely made it (or not) into gifted

```{r}
ggplot(fake_students, aes(x = test, y = earnings, 
                          color = gifted)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = .8) + 
  theme_nice() + 
  labs(x = "Score on IQ test", y = "Current salary", 
       color = "Gifted?") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) + 
  scale_color_paletteer_d(palette = "nationalparkcolors::BlueRidgePkwy", 
                          direction = -1) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(73, 77))
```




## The discontinuity


On average, the students who *by chance* made it in make **less money**

```{r}
ggplot(fake_students, aes(x = test, y = earnings, 
                          color = gifted)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = .8) + 
  theme_nice() + 
  labs(x = "Score on IQ test", y = "Current salary", 
       color = "Gifted?") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) + 
  scale_color_paletteer_d(palette = "nationalparkcolors::BlueRidgePkwy", 
                          direction = -1) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(73, 77)) + 
  geom_label_repel(data = tibble(test = 73.5, earnings = coef(discon_model)[1], 
                                 gifted = "no"), 
                   aes(label = paste("Avg earnings: ", scales::dollar(earnings)))) + 
  geom_label_repel(data = tibble(test = 76.5, 
                                 earnings = coef(discon_model)[1] + coef(discon_model)[2], 
                                 gifted = "yes"), 
                   aes(label = paste("Avg earnings: ", scales::dollar(earnings))))
```

## Baby problems


* Insurance will cover **two nights** in a hospital after delivery


* But how long is "**a night**"? 


* Nights counted by number of *midnights* (*arbitrary cutoff*)


* 👶 born on Monday at 11:59pm = gets Tue + Wed in hospital


* 👶 born on Tuesday at 12:01am = gets Tue + Wed + Thur in hospital (by chance, get extra minimum coverage)



## Finding


1 in 4 babies born after midnight spend an *extra night in hospital* (💵💵💵), even when there is *no health benefit to doing so*

## Other examples: McNamara and the Whiz Kids


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
* What effect did bombing raids in Vietnam have long-term? 

* Problem: the places that *were* bombed are **very different** from the places that were never bombed

* Biggest confound: if bombing accurate, places that were most bombed had most Vietcong presence

## McNamara and the Whiz Kids


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
* Decision to bomb based on **threat scoring system** (1, very secure, to 5, very insecure)
* Final score based on average of sub-scores, then **rounded** to whole number so:

## How do we know we have a natural experiment?


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
* In a true experiment, the treatment and control group should look **similar** or **balanced** demographically

* i.e., if I put people into two groups **at random**, it should be very unlikely that the average person in the control is 22 years old and the average in treatment group is 55 years old

* One thing we can do is **compare** the characteristics of the treatment and control group in our natural experiment; are they in fact similar?



:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lottery-machine.jpeg")
```

:::
:::






## Are they similar? Back to the gifted program


It looks like people close to the cutoff are pretty balanced 


```{r}
subset_students |> 
  select(Age:smoker, gifted, -Grade) |> 
  mutate(Sex = ifelse(Sex == "Female", 1, 0)) |> 
  group_by(gifted) |> 
  summarise(across(everything(), mean)) |> 
  mutate(Sex = Sex * 100,
         smoker = smoker * 100) |> 
  select(`Gifted?` = gifted, `Average age` = Age, `Percent women` = Sex, `Average height` = Height, 
         `Percent drug use` = smoker) |> 
  kbl(digits = 1)
```



**Some** evidence we have a natural experiment



## Why *some* evidence?


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

* If checking for balance is a way to see if we have a natural experiment, why can't we always do this?

* Want to know the effect of X on Y; test for balance on X; if balanced we are good to go / not confounded

* Remember the problem is often we don't know what confounds are out there! Or we know, but can't measure them!

* Checking for balance is **suggestive, weak evidence** that we have a natural experiment

## Big picture


Natural experiments are "strongest" causal tool, and regression discontinuity designs are probably the most convincing version


. . .

Easy to implement; less worry about confounding; the tough part? Finding one! And collecting the data

. . .

Often the result of some rule, boundary, or some other random, **arbitrary** process having a sudden impact in the world

. . .


Premium on: *specific* knowledge of a particular region/area/issue




## 🚨 Your turn: 🧠🧠🧠 🚨


With the person to your right (or whatever):


1. Write down as many rules, demarcations, cutoffs, etc., out there in the world that you can think of. 

2. Can any of these create an opportunity for a natural experiment, where *something* happens to some people/countries/places but not to others as a result of this rule/cutoff/thing? 

3. What problem could that natural experiment help solve? In the gifted program case: the IQ test cutoff helps solve the problem of estimating the effect of gifted programs on future success. 

4. Post a summary in the Slack and if the idea is good enough I will steal it and publish it.

# Limitations {.center background-color="#dc354a"}

## No free lunch

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
* Natural experiments are great but there are limitations:

* **Changing estimate** If we find a good one, the thing we are trying to estimate likely changes (is this bad? depends)

* **Sorting at the cutoff** If there's a rule out there that has consequences, people will do what they can to end up on the right side of it

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/school-lunch.png")

## Limitations: changing estimates


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
By focusing on units near cutoff, our estimate subtly changes: 

* ~~effect of putting *a child* in gifted on future earnings, on average~~

* effect of putting a child *with roughly 75 IQ* in gifted on earnings ✅

* Is this a problem? Depends, but better to know one narrow(er) fact that nothing at all?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, out.width="100%"}

                          color = gifted)) +

           fill = "coral3", alpha = .4)
```
:::
:::









## Limitations: "sorting around the cutoff"


There is also a risk that if people *know* about the cutoff they will behave strategically in ways that **confound our estimate** 

. . .

Imagine that there is room to pressure/bully the school psychologist into turning a 74.9 into a 75 so little Timmy can be gifted

. . .


And image wealthier/better-connected/etc parents are better bullies than poor parents

. . .

In that case, being gifted is no longer *random* 


. . .


wealthy parents **cause** you to get over the cutoff




## Sorting around the cut-off


If parents can force almost-there kids into gifted, parents become a **backdoor path to earnings** (since your parents likely affect your earnings directly, or in other ways)


```{r, out.width="90%"}
dagify(earnings ~ gifted + parents, 
       gifted ~ parents, 
       exposure = "gifted", 
       outcome = "earnings") %>% 
  ggdag_status(text = FALSE, use_labels = "name") + theme_dag() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```



## 🚨 Your turn: sorting around the cutoff 🚨


Think back to the arbitrary cutoff you came up with in the last exercise. Discuss again with your neighbor:


1. Could someone "game" or sort around that cutoff? 
2. What would that look like? 
3. And how could it confound your estimate / ruin the natural experiment?
