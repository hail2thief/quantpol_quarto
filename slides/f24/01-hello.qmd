# Does **decapitation** work? {.center  background-color="`r full`"}


## The data: Milton and Price (2020)


```{r decap}
set.seed(1990)
df = haven::read_dta("../../files/example-scripts/MiltonPrice_II_Final.dta") 

df %>% 
  # turn dummy into yes/no
  mutate(decap = ifelse(decap == 1, "Yes", "No")) |> 
  mutate(failure = ifelse(failure == 1, "Yes", "No")) |> 
  filter(name %in% c("al-Qaeda", 
                     "April 19 Movement (M-19)", 
                     "Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF)")) %>% 
  select(Name = name, Year = year, 
         `Decapitated?` = decap, `Collapsed?` = failure) %>% 
  group_by(Name) %>% 
  slice(1:2) %>% 
  kbl()

```



## The results: a big effect!


```{r model}
m1 = glm(failure ~ decap, data = df)
pDat = ggeffects::ggeffect(m1, terms = "decap") %>% as_tibble()


ggplot(pDat, aes(x = factor(x), 
                 y = predicted, 
                 ymin = conf.low, 
                 ymax = conf.high, 
                 color = factor(x))) + 
  geom_pointrange(size = 2, fatten = 2, 
                  alpha = .8) +

                     limits = c(0, .2)) + 
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(0, 1), labels = c("No", "Yes")) + 
  labs(x = "Was the group decapitated?", 
       y = "Likelihood of group collapse in any given year") +

        panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c(red, blue)) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  ggrepel::geom_label_repel(aes(label = c("Probability of collapse: 2.2%", "Probability of collapse: 9.6%")), 
                            nudge_x = -.2)

What do you think?

## Not so fast...

. . .

Groups that **are** decapitated are *different* from groups that **aren't** decapitated
    
. . .


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
df |> 
  filter(decap == 1) |> 
  distinct(name) |> 
  sample_n(4) |> 
  kbl(col.names = "Groups that were decapitated")
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
df |> 
  filter(decap == 0) |> 
  distinct(name) |> 
  sample_n(4) |> 
  kbl(col.names = "Groups that weren't decapitated")
```
:::
:::


. . .

The groups that *are* decapitated might be the **weakest** ones, the ones that states **especially** want to destroy, ones where leaders are more **important**, etc. 

. . .

We need to **adjust** for these differences



# What is this class about? {.center  background-color="`r full`"}

. . .

**Wrangling** and **visualizing** data to explore the questions we care about

. . .

Using **models** to describe how one political variable might cause another 

. . .

Thinking **causally** about the relationships we observe

. . .

Grappling with **uncertainty** in the relationships we observe





## An emphasis on **doing**


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- *No readings*
- regular, *sustained* practice with hands-on problem sets
- 10 weeks of focused study in **R**, a powerful and in-demand programming language
:::

## Class philosophy:


Little to none of this: 

$$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \mu)^2} {n}$$

. . . 

Lots of this: 

```{r,eval = FALSE,echo = TRUE}
prison |> 
  # look at california
  filter(state == "California") |> 
  # measure variation over time
  summarise(prison_sd = sd(incarcerated_total, na.rm = TRUE))
```



## This class is practical


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
This class *could* be a couple lines on a resume:


- Ability to work with data ➡️ marketable

- R is popular in industry

- Familiarity with R ➡️ other languages

- Principles learned in R can be applied elsewhere (Excel)

- Problem-solving in Slack

## There's a lot of work (and coding) in this class


::: columns

## Inspiration


> It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

## For the love of all that is good

. . . 

**Do** the weekly check-ins; they are free points

. . . 

**Go** to section, ask for help on Slack

. . . 

**Do not** miss homeworks in this class

. . . 

Missing one = leaving a big chunk of your final exam blank

. . . 

I want students who are working hard to do well, but *I can't save you* 🎶
