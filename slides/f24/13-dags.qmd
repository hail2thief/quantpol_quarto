. . .

Why DAG?


. . .


Identifying effects


. . .


`ggdag()`



## Why DAG


We want to identify the effect of X (waffles) on Y (divorce)

. . .

We can use our model to identify that effect, BUT:

. . .

We also know that **lurking variables** might make things go awry (the South)




## Why DAG


We know that the DAG on the left will produce the **spurious** correlation on the right


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
dagify(Divorce ~ South, 
       Waffle ~ South, 
       exposure = "Waffle",
       outcome = "Divorce", 
       coords = list(x = c(Waffle = 0, Divorce = 2, South = 1), 
                      y = c(Waffle = 0, Divorce = 0, South = 1))) %>% 
  ggdag_status(text = FALSE, use_labels = "name") + theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
ggplot(WaffleDivorce, aes(x = WaffleHouses/Population, y = Divorce)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, fill = red, alpha = .8, shape = 21, color = "white") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = red, fill = red) + 
  theme_nice() + 
  labs(x = "Waffle Houses per million residents", 
       y = "Divorce rate per 1,000 adults")
```
:::
:::


Regardless of whether or not waffles cause divorce




## Why not control for everything? 

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Controlling for the wrong thing can *close* a **perplexing pipe** -- this erases **part** or **all** of the effect that X has on Y


```{r}
dagify(Y ~ Z, 
       Z ~ X,
       exposure = "X",
       outcome = "Y", 
       coords = list(x = c(Y = 2, X = 0, Z = 1), 
                      y = c(Y = 0, X = 0, Z = 0))) %>% 
  ggdag_status(text = FALSE, use_labels = "name", stylized = TRUE) +
  theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Or *open* up an **exploding collider** -- creates weird correlation between X and Y

```{r}
collider_triangle(x = "X", y = "Y", m = "Z") %>% 
  ggdag_status(text = FALSE, use_labels = "name", stylized = TRUE) +
  theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Example: Bias in police use of force


Are the police more likely to use deadly force against people of color?

. . .

*Black Americans are 3.23 times more likely than white Americans to be killed by police* (Schwartz and Jahn, 2020)

. . .

Yet there are big debates about how exactly to estimate this bias (and the extent to which it exists)


. . .

Fryer (2019) finds that Blacks and Hispanics are 50% more likely to be stopped by police, but that *conditional on being stopped by the police*, there are no racial differences in officer-involved shootings




## Bias in use of force

Fryer used extensive controls about the nature of the interaction, time of day, and hundreds of factors that I’ve captured with `Confounds`

```{r, out.width="90%"}
coords = list(x = c(Minority = .5, Stop = .5, Force = 1, 
                                 Confounds = .5), 
                           y = c(Minority = .1, Stop = 0, Force = .1, 
                                 Confounds = .25))
dag = dagify(Force ~ Stop + Suspicion + Confounds + Minority, 
             Minority ~ Confounds, 
             Stop ~ Minority + Suspicion, 
             exposure = "Minority", 
             outcome = "Force", 
             latent = "Suspicion",
             coords = coords)

ggdag_status(dag, text = FALSE, use_labels = "name", stylized = TRUE) +
  theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```




## Bias in use of force


Fryer shows that once you account for the indirect effect, the direct effect is basically not there -- once the police has stopped someone, they do **not** use deadly force more often against Minorities than Whites


```{r, out.width="90%"}
dag = dagify(Force ~ Stop + Suspicion + Confounds + Minority, 
             Minority ~ Confounds, 
             Stop ~ Minority + Suspicion, 
             exposure = "Minority", 
             outcome = "Force", 
             latent = "Suspicion",
             coords = coords)

ggdag_status(dag, text = FALSE, use_labels = "name", stylized = TRUE) +
  theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


## Bias in police use of force


But what if police are more likely to stop people they believe are "suspicious" AND use force against people they find "suspicious"? THEN conditioning on the stop is equivalent to [conditioning on a collider]{.red}


```{r, out.width="80%"}
dag = dagify(Force ~ Stop + Suspicion + Confounds + Minority, 
             Minority ~ Confounds, 
             Stop ~ Minority + Suspicion, 
             exposure = "Minority", 
             outcome = "Force", 
             latent = "Suspicion",
             coords = list(x = c(Minority = .5, Stop = .5, Force = 1, 
                                 Confounds = .5, 
                                 Suspicion = .75), 
                           y = c(Minority = .1, Stop = -.1, Force = .1, 
                                 Suspicion = -.25, 
                                 Confounds = .25)))

ggdag_status(dag, text = FALSE, use_labels = "name", stylized = TRUE) +
  theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```



## Tough!


We'd like to know if Minorities are killed more than Whites in police interactions **once they are stopped**

But controlling for **being stopped** creates collider bias

Super tough to estimate the effect of race ➡️ police abuse with observational data!


```{r, out.width="80%"}
dag = dagify(Force ~ Stop + Suspicion + Confounds + Minority, 
             Minority ~ Confounds, 
             Stop ~ Minority + Suspicion, 
             exposure = "Minority", 
             outcome = "Force", 
             latent = "Suspicion",
             coords = list(x = c(Minority = .5, Stop = .5, Force = 1, 
                                 Confounds = .5, 
                                 Suspicion = .75), 
                           y = c(Minority = .1, Stop = -.1, Force = .1, 
                                 Suspicion = -.25, 
                                 Confounds = .25)))

ggdag_status(dag, text = FALSE, use_labels = "name", stylized = TRUE) +
  theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


# What do we do? {.center background-color="`r full`"}


We have to be careful and slow

. . .

Think carefully about what the DAG *probably* looks like

. . .


Use the DAG to figure out what we need to control 

(and what must be left alone)


. . .


**Next time:** how to actually control for stuff




## Why experiments work


DAGs can also help us see why experiments "work":



```{r}
experiment = tibble(Person = 1:5, 
       `Shown an ad?` = c("Yes", "No", "Yes", "No", "No"), 
       `Democrats thermometer` = round(runif(n = 5, min = 0, max = 100) + 10*I(`Shown an ad?` == "Yes"), 2))

knitr::kable(experiment, digits = 2)
```




## Why experiments work


Experiments seem simple...



```{r}
dagify(Support ~ Ad, 
       exposure = "Ad", 
       outcome = "Support") %>% 
  ggdag_status(text = FALSE, use_labels = "name") + theme_dag() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```



## Why experiments work


But the outcome can be very complex ... 

And yet we can still **identify** the effect because nothing **causes** you to receive the experimental treatment; it is random!



```{r,out.width="90%"}
dagify(Support ~ Ad + Age + Income + Race + Region + Religion +
         Parents + Media, 
       Income ~ Region + Parents, 
       Religion ~ Parents, 
       Media ~ Parents + Religion + Age + Region, 
       exposure = "Ad", 
       outcome = "Support") %>% 
  ggdag_status(text = FALSE, use_labels = "name") + theme_dag() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```



## When experiments go wrong


Say the ad experiment was implemented on TikTok, and **younger people are more likely to use TikTok** than older people




```{r, out.width="70%"}
dagify(Support ~ Ad + Age + Income + Race + Region + Religion +
         Parents + Media, 
       Income ~ Region + Parents, 
       Religion ~ Parents, 
       Media ~ Parents + Religion + Age + Region, 
       Ad ~ Age,
       exposure = "Ad", 
       outcome = "Support") %>% 
  ggdag_status(text = FALSE, use_labels = "name") + theme_dag() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


This means **Age** is now a *fork*

## Front-doors and back-doors


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Judea Pearl's **back-door criterion** ties this all together

- Confounding caused by existence of an open “**back door**” path from X to Y

- A backdoor path is *a non-causal path from X to Y*

- Need to close back-doors and keep front-doors open
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("slides/img/backdoor.jpeg"))
```
:::
:::



## Backdoor paths


A backdoor path can involve a chain of variables -- like the **fork**, but with more steps

Here we have a backdoor path between X and Y that runs through `a`, `b`, and `m`

```{r, out.width="70%"}
dag = dagify(y ~ b, 
      x ~ a, 
      a ~ m,
      b ~ m,
      exposure = "x", 
      outcome = "y", 
      coords = list(x = c(y = 2, x = 0, a = 0, b = 2, m = 1),
                          y = c(y = 0, x = 0, a = 1, b = 1, m = .5)))

ggdag_status(dag, stylized = TRUE) +
  theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```



## Breaking the path


We can identify X $\rightarrow$ Y by controlling for **any** variable in the backdoor path to break the chain: `m`, `a`, or `b`

```{r, out.width="70%"}
dag = dagify(y ~ b, 
      x ~ a, 
      a ~ m,
      b ~ m,
      exposure = "x", 
      outcome = "y", 
      coords = list(x = c(y = 2, x = 0, a = 0, b = 2, m = 1),
                          y = c(y = 0, x = 0, a = 1, b = 1, m = .5)))

ggdag_status(dag, stylized = TRUE) +
  theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


## Solve the DAG



```{r}
dagify(Y ~ X + I + A, 
       X ~ A + S, 
       A ~ S, 
       I ~ S, 
       exposure = "X",

# Making DAGs in R {visibility="hidden"}
---


## The makings of a DAG {visibility="hidden"}


We can use the `dagify()` function, from `ggdag`, to make a DAG


```{r}
dagify(Y ~ X + P + A + I,
       X ~ P,
       A ~ I + P,
       exposure = "X", 
       outcome = "Y") %>% 
  ggdag_status(text = FALSE, use_labels = "name") + theme_dag() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```



## The makings of a DAG {visibility="hidden"}


Using same syntax as `lm()`, specify all of the **causes** of each of the variables in the `dagify()` function


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval  = FALSE}
dagify(Y ~ X + P + A + I)
```


"*Y is caused by X, P, A and I*"




## The makings of a DAG {visibility="hidden"}


Using same syntax as `lm()`, specify all of the **causes** of each of the variables in the `dagify()` function


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
dagify(Y ~ X + P + A + I,
       X ~ P,
       A ~ I + P)
```


"*Y is caused by X, P, A and I*"

"*X is caused by P*"

"*A is caused by I and P*"




## The makings of a DAG {visibility="hidden"}


```{r, echo = TRUE}
dag = dagify(Y ~ X + P + A + I,
             X ~ P, 
             A ~ I + P,
             exposure = "X", 
             outcome = "Y")
```


Finally, tell R which variable is the **treatment** ("exposure") and **outcome**


::: {.callout-note}
store the DAG as an object
:::



## Plotting with ggdag {visibility="hidden"}


We can plot our DAG object using `ggdag`

```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="70%"}
ggdag(dag)
```

::: {.callout-note}
The plots produced by `ggdag` will vary randomly
:::



## Seeing the paths {visibility="hidden"}


We can see all the paths from X to Y using `ggdag_paths()`:

```{r, echo=TRUE, out.width="70%"}
ggdag_paths(dag)
```


::: {.callout-note}
`1` is a front-door path, `2` and `3` are backdoor
:::



## What to control for? {visibility="hidden"} 


We identify what to control for using `ggdag_adjustment_set` (in this case `P`):

```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="70%"}
ggdag_adjustment_set(dag)
```


::: {.callout-note}
"Adjust for" and "control for" are synonyms
:::


## Optional: clean it up {visibility="hidden"}


Can add some extra code to make the graph nice: 

```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="70%"}
ggdag(dag, text = FALSE, use_labels = "name") + theme_dag()
```


## Optional: words instead of letters {visibility="hidden"}


We can also use words (no spaces!) instead of letters

```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="50%"}
dag2 = dagify(child ~ grandpa + parent + neighborhood, 
       parent ~ grandpa + neighborhood, 
       exposure = "grandpa",
       outcome = "child")
ggdag(dag2, text = FALSE, use_labels = "name") + theme_dag()
```



## A variable cannot cause itself {visibility="hidden"}

Explanation takes us into the weeds, but DAGs are *acyclical*, meaning: a variable cannot be its own cause (even indirectly):

```{r}
dag = dagify(Y ~ Z, 
             Z ~ X, 
             X ~ Y, 
             exposure = "X", 
             outcome = "Y", 
             coords = list(x = c(X = 0, Y = 1, Z = 2), 
                           y = c(X = 0, Y = 1, Z = 0)))
ggdag_status(dag, text = FALSE, use_labels = "name", stylized = TRUE) +
  theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c(blue, red, yellow)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(blue, red, yellow))
```


## A variable cannot cause itself {visibility="hidden"}

If you have a cycle in your DAG, `ggdag_adjustment_set()` will return this:


```{r}
ggdag_adjustment_set(dag)
```




## 🐶 Your turn: make your own DAG 🐶 {visibility="hidden"}


There's (bad!) research out there that says having a [dog]{.blue} increases a person's [life expectancy]{.red}. Think about all of the variables that affect each. 


1. Make a DAG to represent all of those relationships. Post your DAG in the Slack. 

2. Use the tools we learned to identify all the paths from one variable to the other. 

3. Use the tools to identify what **backdoor paths** need to be accounted for.
